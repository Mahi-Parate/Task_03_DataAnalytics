# Task_03_DataAnalytics
# Retail Orders Database – Querying Fundamentals

## Project Overview
This project is designed to practice and learn basic SQL querying techniques using a mock retail dataset. The dataset contains weekly sales data for stores along with related attributes like temperature, fuel prices, and unemployment rates.

You will apply SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, and date functions to extract meaningful insights from the data.


## Tools Used
- **MySQL** – for database creation and querying
- **SQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin / Command Line** – for running queries
- **CSV File**– source data for import




##  Key SQL Concepts Practiced
✔ SELECT statements  
✔ Filtering data using WHERE  
✔ Sorting using ORDER BY  
✔ Aggregating data using GROUP BY and functions like SUM(), AVG(), MAX()  
✔ Joining tables with INNER JOIN  
✔ Using date functions like YEAR(), MONTH(), and DATE_SUB()

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Import the provided CSV file into MySQL using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.
3. Run the provided SQL queries in your MySQL environment.
4. Modify and experiment with queries to explore the data further.

## Files in this Repository
- `retail_sales.csv` – Dataset file
- `queries.sql` – SQL queries for practice
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)

##  Notes
Ensure `local_infile` is enabled in MySQL to import data from CSV files.  
 The `Date` column should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format for proper parsing.  
 Sample queries cover both aggregation and date-related functions to strengthen SQL skills.
